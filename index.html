          <p>Hello! Yes. This is typically how you will find me at home as I code away. My tabby Ash, conure Cosmo, and lap-cat Frank are in position as usual and are always more than eager to join in on the fun.</p><br>

          <p>How did I manage to get get them to smile pretty for the camera all at the same time, you ask? This is when my Photoshop skills come in super handy. I took a series of pictures, sewed them together, and put their best faces forward. Don't let that fool you though, they really did sit together as usual during the entire shoot.</p>
